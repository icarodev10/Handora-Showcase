## 💡 About The Project

**Handora** solves a critical problem in Industry 4.0: how to interact with digital systems when your hands are dirty, greasy, or when working in sterile environments.

Using **MediaPipe** for hand tracking, it allows operators to control data dashboards, request parts from the warehouse, and navigate the OS using purely **contactless gestures**, integrated directly with the **SGMI** (Industrial Maintenance Management System).

### 🚀 Key Features

* **👆 Touchless Navigation:** Mouse cursor simulation using 3D Euclidean distance with Hysteresis algorithms to prevent cursor jitter.
* **🏭 Industrial Integration:** Real-time connection to the SGMI database to display asset status and sensor data.
* **🔐 Role-Based Access Control:** Secure authentication flow (Admin/Operator) using hashed credentials.
* **🛡️ Safety First:** Designed to avoid false positives in busy industrial backgrounds.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

Although the source code is proprietary, the system was built using a robust modern stack:

* **Core Backend:** Python 3.11 (Optimized for MediaPipe compatibility).
* **API Layer:** Flask & FastAPI (Handling asynchronous requests and WebSockets).
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV + MediaPipe (Low-latency tracking).
* **Database:** MySQL (Relational Data for Auth & Industrial Logs).
* **Communication:** REST API & WebSockets for real-time dashboard updates.

### System Architecture
The project follows a **Dual-Service Architecture**:
1.  **Handora Core:** A dedicated service for processing camera feed, detecting landmarks, and translating gestures into OS commands.
2.  **SGMI Backend:** A web service managing the logic, database connections, and frontend dashboards.
